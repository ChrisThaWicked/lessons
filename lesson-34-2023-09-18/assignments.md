# NextJS Assignments

### Easy

**Task:** Create a NextJS application with a basic routing structure and static pages.

**Requirements:**
- Initialize a NextJS project and set up the necessary folders for routing.
- Create at least 3 static pages, for example, Home, About, and Contact, and implement basic navigation among these pages.
- Ensure that the navigation is handled by NextJS‚Äôs `Link` component.
- Style the pages minimally using CSS or a small CSS framework.

### Medium

**Requirements:**
- Implement dynamic routing by creating a page that fetches data using a dynamic route. For example, a User page that fetches data based on user ID.
- Set up at least 2 API routes using NextJS's API routes feature to fetch and display data on your pages. (This could be mock data or fetched from an external API)
- Ensure to manage state and side effects adequately using React hooks.
- Display fetched data on your page dynamically, depending on the URL parameter.
- Ensure your page is able to handle potential issues like loading states, error states, and successful data fetches.

### Hard

**Requirements:**
- Integrate Prisma into your NextJS application and connect it to a database of your choosing.
- Create a new model in Prisma and perform migrations.
- Expand your API routes, now leveraging Prisma to perform CRUD operations on the database.
- On the client side, utilize React Query and Axios to manage the fetching, adding, updating, and deleting of data through the API routes.
- Implement a UI that allows users to interact with all the CRUD operations. Make sure the UI updates optimally based on the data state, such as re-fetching data when it‚Äôs updated.
- Ensure proper error handling, loading states, and success states using React Query.
