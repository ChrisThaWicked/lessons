### Easy

**Task:** Create a React component that fetches and displays a list of items from an API.

**Requirements:**
- Use Axios to fetch data.
- Implement `useQuery` to manage the fetching state (loading, error, and data).
- Display the data in a list format and show loading/error states to the user (e.g., loading spinner, error message).

### Medium

**Task:** Build upon the first assignment or create a new component where a user can add an item to the list by submitting a form.

**Requirements:**
- Implement `useMutation` to handle the API call for adding a new item to the server.
- Use Axios for making POST requests.
- Show loading, success, and error UI states.
- After a successful mutation, refetch the data using `useQuery` to ensure the UI is updated.

### Hard
