# Teachers Notes

## JavaScript Exercises

1. Write a JavaScript program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backwards, for instance “kayak”. 

2. Write a JavaScript program to find the closest value to 100 from two numerical values. 

3. Write a JavaScript program to capitalize the first letter of each word in a given string.

4. Write a JavaScript program to check whether 1 appears in the first or last position of a given array of integers. The array length must be larger than or equal to 1. 

5. Write a JavaScript program to find the longest string from a given array of strings. 

6. Write a JavaScript program to remove a character at the specified position in a given string and return the modified string.

7. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given positive number is a multiple of 3 or 7.

8. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a string "Script" appears at the 5th (index 4) position in a given string. If "Script" appears in the string, return the string without "Script" otherwise return the original one.

9. Write a JavaScript program that checks two integer values and returns true if either one is 15 or if their sum or difference is 15.  

10. Write a JavaScript program to concatenate two strings and return the result. If the length of the strings does not match, then remove the characters from the longer string. 

11. Write a JavaScript program to display the city name if the string begins with "Los" or "New" otherwise return blank.

12. Write a JavaScript program to find the largest value between the first and last elements of an array and set all the other elements to that value. Display the updated array.  

13. Write a JavaScript program to test whether a given array of integers contains 30 and 40 twice. The array length should be 0, 1, or 2. 

14. Write a JavaScript program to find the number appearing most frequently in a given array of integers.

15. Write a JavaScript program to sort the strings of a given array of strings in order of increasing length.  Note: Do not change the order if the lengths of two strings are the same.
