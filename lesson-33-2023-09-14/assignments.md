# TypeScript Assignments

### Easy

**Task:** Create a TypeScript file where you define various variables and functions with strict types.

**Requirements:**
- Define at least 3 different variables with explicit types.
- Create a function that takes in parameters with strict types and returns a value with a strict type.
- Make use of TypeScript’s `interface` or `type` to define the shape of an object.

### Medium

**Task:** Implement a class-based system that leverages TypeScript’s type-checking capabilities.

**Requirements:**
- Define at least one class with properties that have strict types.
- Implement methods within the class that adhere to strict typing rules.
- Leverage interfaces to ensure instances of the class adhere to a strict structure.
- Create instances of the class, ensuring to provide appropriate argument values.

### Hard

**Task:** Create a utility function library that utilizes TypeScript generics and type assertions to work with different data types.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a minimum of 2 utility functions that utilize generics, ensuring they can work with various data types while still maintaining type safety.
- Make use of type assertions within functions to guide TypeScript’s type-checking.
- Create several use-cases or examples showing how these utility functions can be used with different data types.
- Ensure to handle and showcase potential use-cases where type assertions might fail and how to safely navigate these situations.
